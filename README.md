# Advanced-Data-Visualization-Projects

These project are mostly focused on interactive visualization such as heat map that can show the seismic intensity of each place on the map and the distribution of the seismic intensity, bubble chart which is a multivariate chart that is a variant of a scatter plot, and dadar charts are used to compare multiple quantized variables, such as seeing which variables have similar values, or if there are extreme values. They also help to observe which variables in the data set have higher or lower values.
